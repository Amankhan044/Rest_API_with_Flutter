# rest_api_with_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A Flutter app that demonstrates how to make API requests and display data using a REST API. In this app, we fetch a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API and display them in a list.

Features:
- Fetches a list of posts from the JSONPlaceholder API.
- Displays the list of posts in a scrollable list view.
- Shows a loading indicator while fetching data.
